# data-engineer-top-global-chess

This project will utilize the following skills learned in the data engineering zoomcamp

Docker and Docker compose
Google Cloud platform
Airflow
Data warehouse with big query
Analytics Eng with DBT
Batch with Spark

For this project I will use data engineering concepts to load data in the for the top global chess players. Chess is an interest and hobby of mine. 

I'll use this Kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/everydaycodings/top-global-chess-players

This dataset has the description:
This comprehensive collection provides detailed information about the highest-ranked chess players globally.
